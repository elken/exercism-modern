A modern interface to [[https://exercism.org][Exercism]].

* Installation
[[https://github.com/elken/exercism.el/issues/1][Currently]]  depends on [[https://github.com/rougier/svg-lib][svg-lib]]
which will have to be installed manually, otherwise the steps below should be
accurate.

** Standard
Clone the repo, add to your load-path
** MELPA
Install using your favourite package manager
** Doom Emacs
Append the following to the corresponding file:

*** =packages.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! exercism.el
  :recipe (:host github :repo "elken/exercism.el"))
#+end_src

*** =config.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! exercism.el
  :commands (exercism exercism-view-tracks))
#+end_src

* Exercism setup
Currently depends on following the setup mapped out [[https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally][here]], after doing them you
should be fine to use this.

*NOTE* the first time you view the tracks/a specific track there will be a
one-time delay while the icons are downloaded. This will only occur once per the
main tracks view and one per track

* Commands
** =exercism=
Open dired at the exercism workspace directory.
** =exercism-view-tracks=
[[file:.github/assets/tracks.png]]

Main entry point into Exercism; a listing of all the available programming languages that have courses.

Shows your current statistics for overall completion of a track.

Pressing =RET= on a track will open a listing of all the exercises available.
** =exercism-track-view-exercises=
[[file:.github/assets/exercises.png]]

Listing of all exercises available for a given track.

Any exercises not yet unlocked are greyed out.

| key | action                            |
|-----+-----------------------------------|
| =RET= | Download exercise(s)              |
| =m=   | Mark an exercise to be downloaded |
| =u=   | Unmark an exercise                |
| =t=   | Toggle all marks                  |

A more detailed listing of shortcuts available when navigating exercises is available [[https://github.com/politza/tablist][here]].

** =exercism-submit-buffer=
Once you're done with an exercise and you're happy the tests pass, invoke this to submit the current buffer to exercism.
When invoked with the universal argument =C-u= (=SPC u= for Doom Emacs users), prompt for a buffer to submit instead.
